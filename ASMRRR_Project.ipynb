        "We scraped the closing price and many corresponding financial indicators of Bitcoin for the last one thousand days. With this data, we hoped to train some machine learning algorithms to predict the closing price of Bitcoin given the financial indicators. This would help short-term investors who aren't trading on patterns to have a better idea of when the price will rise or fall. We also explored which of our financial indicator features were the most helpful in training the machine learning model.\n"

        "<h4>Problem Statement</h4>\n",
        "\n",
        "We sought to solve the problem of unpredictable cryptocurrency prices. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies that are built on a blockchain that ensures there are no unverified creation or transactions of the currency. This digital asset, like a stock, is valued based on market demand and supply but it is much harder to predict. Stock prices have become more predictable as the history of their prices lengthens. With the amount of cryptocurrencies and the money in them growing, we wanted to apply our new data science knowledge to the cryptocurrency data we do have. For our project, we decided to look into the cyptocurrency with the largest market cap, Bitcoin, and determine whether or not you can predict Bitcoin prices based upon technical indicators, and investment tool used by stakeholders to quantify movements of assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Significance of the Problem</h4>\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many people who are unfamiliar with the technology behind crypto and therefore don't trust investing their money in it. It is seen as an unpredictable asset that cannot be relied upon to be a valid form of investing to remove unpredictably from the equation by making an effective tool to anticipate changes in price. Thus, thus machine learning algorithm can help people make money for you. With the ability to trust a machine learning algorithm, people can take advantage of the investment opportunity that crypto possesses. Our dive into crypto prediction will also provide helpful insights such as what financial indicators are the most helpful at predicting the price.\n",
        "\n",
        "There has been a previous project done on our topic by a Derk Zomer. He used a long short-term memory model that is a form of a neural network that is capable of working in the long-term. Instead of using financial indicators as features, he used trading data which our financial indicators are calculated from, so through the transitive property we used the same features. He standardized his features and performed hyper-parameter tuning on his LSTM model but did not cite the performance of his algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another study, \"Short-term bitcoin market prediction via machine learning\", conducted by Patrick Jaquart, David Dann, and Christof Meinhardt, looks into the application of machine learning in predicting future prices in short ranges, with ranges spanning from the next minute to the next hour. The use minute to minute data over the span of 9 months. They use a wide variety of data beyond simply bitcoin trading data, including twitter sentiment, other asset markets, and information of the blockchain itself. They standardized their data. To process their data, they used various forms of neural networks and gradient boosting classifier, which were not taught in DS 3000. The models ended up having a 50% - 56% accuracy, with the longer periods tending to possess a higher accuracy.\n",

        "We believe that these are important predictors due to the nature of the cryptocurrency market, and how it relates to the stock market. Bitcoin is traded in a similar way to a stock, however there are some key differences. Both are given a value based on how valuable that stakeholders believe they are Though one important factor to is how Bitcoin differs itself from a stock. While a stock’s value is inherently tied to a corporation and the way they operate, Bitcoin's value is solely based on the public’s perception and use of the currency. We cannot look at the company’s finances to make our decisions, so our attention needs to be drawn to how they are traded. Additionally, the cryptocurrency market runs all day as opposed to stock markets which have a set opening and closing period. This makes it that Bitcoin is traded every second and there is no arbitrary point where a trend will be paused. Given that trends have been historically quantified in the stock market, and that the cryptocurrency market is much more susceptible to trends than the stock market, we believe that using a collection of popularly used technical indicators will be effective in predicting Bitcoin value. The actual technical indicators we selected were based on which indications were most used in the industry.\n",

        "    * Similar to linear regression, these 2 different variations on linear regression will impose a different penalty. We can analyze the results of these 2 models to determine which penalty is best in terms of accuracy and scoring metrics. \n",

The fast is representing Bitcoin fundamental value in the short term while the slow is representing its fundamental value in the long term. The trend that can be seen here is that there is more variance in these metrics when there is larger changes and price. And when there is deviation, it tends to be that increases in price increase the short-term value while decreasing the long-term value. Likewise, decreases in price are shown to often increase long term value while decreasing short term value. Although this tends to be the case, it is not absolute. From 100-290, the long-term value was going up with the short-term value, and the long term value was still larger than the short term value."

Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Aroon Indicator give a rating to the strength of trends in the market, however while The Aroon indicator finds this metric using the amount of time between highs and lows, the RSI looks at the strength of recent trends and aims to find if a stock is overbought and over sold. We observe a positive correlation between both variables with a small degree of variance. In this context, it means that when there is less time between highs and lows, Bitcoin tends to be oversold. As the time between highs and lows in the market increases, Bitcoin gets bought more and eventually becomes overbought. This can show that the time between high and lows is a valid metric that signal if Bitcoin is being overbought or oversold."

        "This chart compares the On Balance Volume, and the ADX to find how they influence the price of Bitcoin. On Balance volume is a prediction of a change of price and ADX is a rating of the strength of price changed. When the price of bitcoin was lower, we tended to see a weak trend, where the relationship between ADX and On-Balance column would alternate. Increasing the on-balance volume would go from increasing to decreasing the ADX. However, this changed when bitcoin reached a price of 20,000 dollars. After this point, what can be found in this chart is that the higher the on-balance volume, the lower the trends strength and the higher bitcoins price tended to get. Given that weak trends are leading to price increases, it could be inferred that this recent tend a fluke and that this price growth is unstable, and that it mainly propelled by speculation."

        "All in all, we scraped Bitcoin trading data and used them to calculate technical indicators. From there we extracted the indicators as features and set the bitcoin price as the target. We then scaled the data using the Standard Scaler and ran different types of feature selection, GridSearch and model-based using a DecisionTreeRegressor. Finally, we trained and tested all of the linear, k-nearest-neighbors, support vector, lasso, and ridge regression models on standardized data with, GridSearch and model-based feature selection and compared the R^2 value, mean absolute error, and mean squared error for all of the permutations.\n",

        "### Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "We compared a linear, k-nearest-neighbors, support vector, lasso, and ridge regression algorithms on our dataset. With all features standardized, but with no hyperparameter tuning, the Linear Regression model performed best with mean absolute error of 517. Overall, the KNeighborsRegressor model should be used for our predictive model as it performed best on our training data with a mean absolute error of 418. The best parameters were 'manhattan' metric, 3 n_neighbors, and weights based on 'distance'. Feature selection led to slightly worse results but the linear regression algorithm did perform better with a mean absolute error of about 100. Due to our findings, we conclude that using the features in the way that we outlined in the project cannot be used to accurately predict bitcoins pricing. Although we see very high r^2 even before optimizing our model, the absolute squared error was found to be greater than the value of a Bitcoin at its highest point in history. Even if we just took absolute standard error into consideration, the error is still too high to make any useful predictions. Given these issues, we can conclude that there may be issues with the features we selected themselves.\n",

        "If we were to work on this project in the future, there would be a few aspects that we would change. First would be the number of instances that we included in our dataset. Our dataset contained 1000 rows, which was the default number that our API could generate. However, the history of Bitcoin is a lot more extensive than we had access to. Thus, we would either find a way to modify the code used in the API or find another source for our data to improve our results. This could potentially reduce our error. Additionally, we could add other features on top of these technical indicators to see if it gives us a better understand of the data. We could investigate other markets such as the stock market and the market for natural resources."
